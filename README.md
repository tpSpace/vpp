# v++
# Introduction
This is a simple parser i made for my principle of programing course at my University. It can tokenize, identify the context of the string and do some simple calculation.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
